                        I came onto a team that was in flux after there was some staffing changes and quickly rose to a position of prominence. I trained multiple classes of new hires and brought them up to production quickly. I have an eye for detail that was exemplified by my work within quality control for the products that I supported. In addition, I created reports using Jira and Salesforce to express complex internal concepts in more concise ways that sales could share with the client.
